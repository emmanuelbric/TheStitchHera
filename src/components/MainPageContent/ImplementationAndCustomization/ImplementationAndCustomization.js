        Our solution utilizes machine learning models to analyze fabric images and suggest clothing designs. These models create accurate texture maps and allow real-time modifications to dress models, such as changing sleeve lengths and necklines. This dynamic customization helps me see how different design elements will look on my fabric, ensuring that the final product aligns with my exact preferences and facilitates effective communication with my tailor.
